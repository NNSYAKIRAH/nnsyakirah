	<p> Hello Everyone, </p>
    <P>First of all, thank you for clicking to my page. My name is Nik Nur Syakirah Binti Zakaria. </P>

<p>
Most people call me Kiey, I was born on 29 June 997. I am the fifth of the six sibling in my family. My father, Mr.Zakaria is a retired fish monger and currently work as “PENOREH GETAH” during free time because of health issue. My mother, Mrs. Saripah is a housewife. 
Growing up around with clever siblings was not easy, considering the fact that I am not clever enough to compete with them. There was a lot of competition and rivalry. I had tough or I would been toppled by them. Not that we were a dysfunctional family, it was just normal sibling rivalry and it turned to be of benefit to me.
Since I was second youngest, I was bound to be at the bottom of the totem pole in everything. So, I had to be equally tough to fight for whatever was rightfully mine. As a result, I turned out to be a tomboy and also built a reputation as a no nonsense girl. </justify></p>
